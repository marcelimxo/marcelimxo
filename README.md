# Hi there, I'm Marcelim RondÃ³n ðŸ‘‹

A web developer with a passion for human-centered design. My goal is to build products that bring value and make the web more accessible.  I am often described as a very curious, empathetic and proactive person. I love learning, sharing knowledge, and empowering women through technology, and I am always looking for new challenges.
